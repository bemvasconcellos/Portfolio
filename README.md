## Data Analysis as a hobby

My interest in Data Analysis started as a hobby. I practiced data analysis before even knowing what the area was about. Or better yet, before even knowing how to use the tools. And it was always a natural process: I started playing a game, grew analytical towards builds and items in the game, and then found a way to gather and process data. I believe this says a lot about my analytical profile and long-standing interest in discovering facts through numbers.

Here's an example I'm proud to showcase. It's a spreadsheet comparing weapons in a video game called Fallout: New Vegas. It began as something much simpler and it grew in size, complexity, and usability as I began to grow familiar with sheets.
